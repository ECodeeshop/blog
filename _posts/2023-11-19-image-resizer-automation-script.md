### How it works
1. The script takes a single input image file.
2. It defines a list of predefined sizes to resize the image to (e.g., 16, 32, 48, etc.).
3. For each predefined size, the script creates a new resized image file with the specified dimensions.
4. The resized images are saved in a separate output directory.

You can edit script configuration in params.js file
