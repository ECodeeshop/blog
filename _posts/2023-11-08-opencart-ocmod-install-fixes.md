Hi everyone,

Are you having trouble installing an extension in OpenCart? If so, you're not alone. This is a common issue that many OpenCart users experience.

There are a number of reasons why you may encounter this issue. One possibility is that the opencart have a structure that it follows and would not allow to upload extensions that have different folder structures to fix that issue we have created a extension patch that will fix the OpenCart extension installation issue.

Whatever the reason, there is a quick and easy fix. Simply follow these steps:

Download the extension source code from the download button.
Extract the file.
Upload the customrequirementinstallfix.ocmod.zip file in the OpenCart Extensions > Installer.
This will fix the issue and allow you to install the extension without any problems.

I hope this helps!
